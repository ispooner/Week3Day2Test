Research Questions


1. What is the difference in Dalvik and ART
        Dalvik is the original system for running Android apps. It is a just-in-time compiler that generates Dex bytecode. ART is the current system for running apps. It is an ahead-of-time compiler that generates Dex bytecode. Both use the DEX format, so are technically compatible, though some techniques that worked in Dalvik don’t work with ART. 
2. What is the DEX Limit?
        The DEX Limit of 65536 is the number of references that can be programmed into an App using the DEX format. 
3. What are launch modes?
Standard: launches the activity on top of the stack.
SingleTop: If the top activity is the same then it redirects back to that activity rather than start a new one.
SingleTask: If the activity already exists in the stack, then the intent is redirected back to that activity rather than starting a new one.
SingleInstance: If the activity exists anywhere in the application, then the intent is redirected to that activity rather than starting a new one.  


4. What are form factors?
        Form factors are how different screen sizes and shapes are described. Such as wearables having a round screen, or different phones having different ratio screens and different pixel counts. 
5. What are Layout Qualifiers?
        Layout Qualifiers are how the OS decides which layout to inflate given certain qualifying conditions. These conditions are numerous and contain things such as day/night, layout orientation, localization, time zone, etc.
